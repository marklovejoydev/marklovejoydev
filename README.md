 Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub Profile.
 
 Im so excited to start my coding journey and make this my full time career.
 
 A little about myself I am changing my career from a Regiment Gunner in the RAF in which i spent a fantastic 8 years in service,
 where i had had some incredible life experiances and gained some strong skills that i didnt realise where transferable.
 Such as:
    Adapability
    Problem Solving
    Stong Teamwork
    
Now i have the oppotunity to pursue a career in tech which in the past i only saw as a hobby.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning JavaScript HTML and CSS.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning with Northcoders on there Front-end Web Developer course.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Recently gotten into Anime with a subscription to crunchyroll and realising i have alot of episodes to go through.
